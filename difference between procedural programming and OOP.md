 Procedural Programming is more of what you are doing than how you are doing it. It is the standard approach used in many computer languages such as C, Pascal, 
 and BASIC. While there is no perfect programming paradigm, it is important to understand that the correct paradigm will always depend on the type of language 
 you use and the program you wish to create.
 
 Object Oriented Programming is an approach to programming which recognizes life as we know it as a collection of objects, which work in tandem with each other to solve a particular
 problem at hand. The primary thing to know about OOP is encapsulation, which is the idea that each object which holds the program is self-sustainable, which 
 means that all the components that make up the object are within the object itself. 
 
 ### The diferences between them are as follows<br>
 1. Procedural programming uses immutable data while OOP uses mutabe data
 2. Procedural programming follows the declarative programming model, OOP follows the imperative programming model
 3. Procedural programming extends support to parallel programming, OOP not suitable for parallel programming
 4. The execution order of statements in procedural programming is not the primary focus, OOP focuses mre on the execution order of statements
 5. The focus in Procedural Programming is on ‘What You are Doing’. The focus in Object-Oriented Programming is on ‘How You are Doing It’
 6. Flow control is performed using function calls	in procedural programming. Flow control is performed through conditional statements and loops in OOP

JetBrains made major emphasis on Kotlinâ€™s interaction with existing Java code when developing kotlin. 
The team made sure that kotlin can easily and completely interact with existing Java code.
So that it can become easy for Java developers to migrate their Java project to Kotlin. 
There is also an automatic java-to-Kotlin converter in major IDEs for simplifies migration from Java to Kotlin.

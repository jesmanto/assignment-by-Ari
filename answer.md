 Procedural Programming is more of what you are doing than how you are doing it. It is the standard approach used in many computer languages such as C, Pascal, 
 and BASIC. While there is no perfect programming paradigm, it is important to understand that the correct paradigm will always depend on the type of language 
 you use and the program you wish to create.
 Object Oriented Programming is an approach to programming which recognizes life as we know it as a collection of objects, which work in tandem with each other to solve a particular
 problem at hand. The primary thing to know about OOP is encapsulation, which is the idea that each object which holds the program is self-sustainable, which 
 means that all the components that make up the object are within the object itself.

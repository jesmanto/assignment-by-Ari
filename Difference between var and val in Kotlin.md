Basically, **val** and **var** both are used to declare a variable. **var** is like a general variable and can be assigned multiple times and is known as the mutable 
variable in Kotlin. Whereas **val** is a constant variable and can not be assigned multiple times and can be Initialized only single time and is known as the 
immutable variable in Kotlin.
